# Module-3-Bootstrap-Portfolio
Create a basic portfolio using bootstrap 

# Description
For this challenge we were required to plan and make a portfolio using bootstrap. I commented out the sections I wanted to make and drew a rough sketch using pen and paper. I then made the nav bar and added styling. I set about adding a jumbotron but this does not show now that I have added the cards section. 
This is an issue that I have had throughout and i am unsure how to resolve it. from there I added the cards section using a container fluid. I added 3 images to show what skills we have been learing throughout the bootcamp to date. From here I used a row class to add the about me section. I then added the final HTML code for the footer section. 
At each stage I targetted each class that I ahd used and added styling using my CSS style sheet. 
This was again a very challenging task that I strugglec with. I reached out to Sade to arrange a tutorial but this did not materialise.


# Getting Started
I created a new repo and cloned this to my area. I serached for images that I would need and added them to my images folder. I created the rest of the folder structure including the css and html files. 
I made the project using VS code, html, css and bootstrap example code.

# Problems I faced 
I had several problems with this project and found it quite difficult. I continually get an error message when trying to commit to git hub. Im lack the knowledge to be able to find out the issues. I had a jumbotron in place in earlier versions but when I added the cards section it has since disappeared. I find the css styling extremely difficult as again I lack the required knowledge to understand what many things do.
